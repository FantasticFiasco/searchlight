### Application icon

The application icon has been generated using [Iconion](http://iconion.com/), and all resolutions of that image can be found in the `./app-icon` folder with a filename format of `*-raw.png`.

Because of the horrendous compression of images from Iconion, the images have been re-saved using [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/), and those images have the file format of `*.png`.
